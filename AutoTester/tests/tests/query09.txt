cat: Test for Follows(*), Parent(*), Modifies, Uses,pattern
1 - Follow, pattern :: Select while loops that are nested in other while when an assignment modifies l and uses 9.
while w; assign a;
Select w such that Follows(_,w) pattern a("l",_"9"_);
3, 6, 10, 16, 19
5000
2 - Follow*, pattern :: Select assignment a1 that is followed by assignment a2 modifies i and uses i.
assign a1,a2;
Select a1 such that Follows*(a1,a2) pattern a2("i",_"i"_);

3 - Parent, Typed :: Select BOOLEAN if there exists a Uses relationship.
while w;
Select BOOLEAN such that Parent(w,10) pattern w("f",_);
false

4 - Parent*, pattern :: Select statement s if it modifies y when there is while loop has control var k.
stmt s;while w;
Select s such that Modifies(s,"y") pattern w("k",_);

5 - Modifies, pattern :: Select assignment a1 if there exists an assignment a2 with d =10?
assign a1,a2;

6 - Modifies, pattern :: Select while if it modifies l and there exists an assignment modifies variable y and uses y?
assign a; while w;
Select w such that Modifies(w,"l") pattern a("y",_"y"_);

7 - Modifies, pattern :: Select BOOLEAN if there exists an assignment modifies variable c and there exists while loop using x as control variable?
stmt s; while w;
Select BOOLEAN such that Modifies(s,"c") pattern w("x",_);
true

8 - Uses,Pattern :: Which is the assigment modifies c uses e and z?
assign a;
